# m3u-Creator
It's a .bat script I wrote to automatically create .m3u playlist for .chd files

Just place the script in the folder you have the .chd files and the script will create your .m3u automatically

I also included the CHDMAN files in this repo, so you can convert your CUE/GDI/ISO files to CHD

### CUE_GDI_ISO_to_CHD
Compresses either disc format to CHD (V5). (Will search all sub-folders and make CHDs in folder this is used in with CHDMAN.

### CHD_to_CUE
Decompresses CHD (V5) to CUE. (CUE is used by CD-based games. On the Raspberry Pi, CHD is supported by TurboGrafx-CD/PC Engine CD, Sega CD/Mega CD, and Dreamcast)

### CHD_to_GDI
Decompresses CHD (V5) to GDI. (GDI is used by Dreamcast.)

I couldn't find any real info on who created CHDMAN, only one shoutout to [Zet-sensei](https://github.com/Zet-sensei) so shoutout to him here aswell.
