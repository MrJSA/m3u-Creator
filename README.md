# m3u-Creator
It's a .bat script I wrote to automatically create .m3u playlist for .chd files

Just place the script in the folder you have the .chd files and the script will create your .m3u automatically

I also included the CHDMAN files in this repo, so you can convert your CUE/GDI/ISO files to CHD

I couldn't find any real info on who created CHDMAN, only one shoutout to [Zet-sensei](https://github.com/Zet-sensei) so shoutout to him here aswell.
