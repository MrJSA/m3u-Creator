# m3u-Creator
It started with a .bat script I wrote to automatically create .m3u playlist for .chd files

### I also included the CHDMAN files in this repo, so this repo is all you need to convert your CUE/GDI/ISO files to CHD and M3U

### chd_m3u_creator
makes a M3U file with the names of all the CHD files in the same folder as this script.
Just place the script in the folder you have the .chd files and the script will create your .m3u automatically

### CUE_GDI_ISO_to_CHD
Compresses either disc format to CHD (V5). (Will search all sub-folders and make CHDs in folder this is used in with CHDMAN.

### CHD_to_CUE
Decompresses CHD (V5) to CUE. (CUE is used by CD-based games. On the Raspberry Pi, CHD is supported by TurboGrafx-CD/PC Engine CD, Sega CD/Mega CD, and Dreamcast)

### CHD_to_GDI
Decompresses CHD (V5) to GDI. (GDI is used by Dreamcast.)

I couldn't find any real info on who created CHDMAN, only one shoutout to [Zet-sensei](https://github.com/Zet-sensei) so shoutout to him here aswell.
